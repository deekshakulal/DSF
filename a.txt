NAME: Mary Smith 
MRN:12345 
DICTATED BY: Dr. John Lee 
ADMISSION DATE: 11/29/14 
DISCHARGE DATE: 12/1/14 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute COPD exacerbation 
DISPOSITION: Home in stable and improved condition. 
FOLLOW UP: I have asked the patient to follow with her PCP within the next week. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 
Please refer to the H&P on 11/29/14. 
1. COPD exacerbation 
a. The patient is a very pleasant 67 year old woman with severe COPD. She 
came in quite short of breath and tachypnic with respiratory distress. 
She was treated with steroids and nebulizer treatments and improved 
over her 2 day stay. She narrowly avoided intubation. Today on my 
exam, she has slightly tight breathing sounds throughout which I think is 
her baseline. Her lungs sound more open today. She does get somewhat 
hypoxic with exertion but does not qualify for oxygen at this point. The 
patient is otherwise stable and I have asked her to follow up with her PCP 
within the next week. She will be given a short course of prednisone and 
antibiotics for 5 days. She should have PFTs when stable. 
2. Hypertension 
a. Initially high but stabilized by the time of discharge. BP 138/88 
3. Hyperlipidemia 
a. Stable. Follow up with PCP. 
4. Hypothyroidism 
a. Stable 
5. Osteoporosis 
a. Stable
